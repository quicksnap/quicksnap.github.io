      <p>
        I am a full-stack engineer based in Portland, Oregon. I have many years
        of experience creating and delivering quality software on professional
        teams. When programming, I focus on code clarity and simplicity. When
        working with others, I shoot for a no-ego mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have expertise in frontend development architecture, and have
        developed effective patterns with React and associated libraries. I also have
        substantial backend and native software experience as will, including:
        Node, Golang, Java, React Native, Objective-C, C++, Ruby, and PHP. Across
        my career, I have worked in numerous cloud and on-premises environments, along
        with bundled software.
